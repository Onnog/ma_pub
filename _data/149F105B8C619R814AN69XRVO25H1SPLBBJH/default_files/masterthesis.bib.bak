	applied in the testing of strength-optimized locally reinforced laminates
	whose design has been explained in Part I. The measurement methods
	are an optical surface method, based on Digital Image Correlation
	(DIC), and measurements of Acoustic Emission (AE) which can originate
	from anywhere within the test specimen. Both methods are intended
	to identify early damage events or accumulation and the corresponding
	loads are compared to predicted first-ply-failure loads. The \{DIC\}
	method identifies non-linearities in the displacement path which
	infer that damage events have occurred. The \{AE\} method utilizes
	the signal energy rate per time to identify damage events. The results
	of the particular specimens show no correlation between the two measurement
	methods. The averaged values for the different type specimens show
	a significant dependency.},

  abstract = {Abstract The paper reports on a strength improvement method based
	on the recently published Ghost-Layer concept by Schläpfer and Kress
	[1] for identifying local reinforcements to a composite structure
	which is simulated with the finite element method. A pseudo-strength
	function (PSF) unifies the failure indices of the laminate layers
	of each finite element and allows for semi-analytical calculation
	of sensitivities with respect to layer thickness changes. Local reinforcements
	are generated by assigning a thickness value to parts of the virtual
	Ghost-Layers based on the sensitivity information. The method, manufacturing
	of test specimens, and validation are presented. High strength increase
	can be achieved with small amounts of additional mass. Details of
	the measurement techniques are presented in part \{II\} of this paper.

  abstract = {This paper presents a sensitivity-based approach for an automated
	generation of laminated composite structures with local reinforcement
	doublers. The method is demonstrated on the problem of finding structural
	design solutions with maximal frequency-to-mass ratios but can be
	extended to optimization of different objectives. Eigenvalue sensitivities
	on finite element level with respect to the thickness of laminate
	layers are derived analytically and provide the basis for the generation
	of laminate doublers. Sensitivities can also be evaluated for non-existent
	layers, namely Ghost Layers. Predefined material properties and orientations
	are assigned to them but their thickness is specified to zero by
	a thickness control factor. Assigning a real thickness to parts of
	these layers, which is controlled by sensitivity information, creates
	local reinforcement doublers. The locally reinforced solutions are
	superior to solutions with fully covered layers in terms of eigenfrequency-to-mass
	ratio. Due to the choice of the parameterization and the iterative
	thickening process, solutions can be manufactured without significant
	modifications. The efficiency as well as the solution quality is
	demonstrated with a numerical experiment. },

  journal = {Composite Structures },

  pages = {433 - 442},

  abstract = {An approach for the specific design of laminated composites structures
	with local reinforcements regarding their dynamic behavior is presented.
	It is based on the sensitivity-based parameterization concept which
	has been presented in [1]. The search for best structural performance
	calls for a local adaption of the laminate properties to the inhomogeneous
	internal load distributions in order to take advantage of the anisotropic
	characteristics. If designing a structure regarding dynamic behavior,
	eigenfrequencies are often pushed above the essential excitation
	frequencies in order to prevent dynamic coupling. However, dynamic
	coupling can also be prevented by creating a resonance-free band
	in the range of the excitation source. Local reinforcements allow
	a specific shifting the eigenfrequencies for generating a resonance-free
	band. Different objective functions, which separate a pair of eigenfrequencies,
	are presented. A design solution is physically realized to verify
	the existence of a resonance-free band. A manufacturing process,
	called sequential curing process, is presented which allows the production
	of high-quality locally reinforced structures by separating the curing
	of basic structure and reinforcements into two temperature cycles.
	Eigenfrequencies and modes of the panel are measured with a scanning-vibrometer.
	The experimental results show high agreement with the simulation
	and the resonance-free band is confirmed.},
